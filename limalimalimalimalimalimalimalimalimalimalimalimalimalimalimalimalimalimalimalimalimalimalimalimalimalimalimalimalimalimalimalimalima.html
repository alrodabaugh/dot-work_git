            <p>Break-Up Tunnel Vision Infinity is a series of dances cycling between Lima, OH and NYC, where my hope to
                break out of tunnel vision imposed by social media, only left me clear-eyed in an atmosphere of real
                life hatred, rising fascist sentiments and the people fighting to stop them. These dances are a search
                for meaning in a splintered
                American reality that has become increasingly
                fractured since I began it. In 2019, I returned to my conservative birthplace to create a dance. With
                four NYC dancers originally from the Midwest, for one hour, they danced with scored improvisation to
                throbbing industrial techno, sincere competition dance moves, a familial reckoning, and a quiet moment
                of solitude. This first edition was a return to my roots, to see why there was growing support for
                far-right politics beyond my virtual perspective and to remember that I was from here too.</p>

            <p>The 2nd edition flourished in NYC, as part of Dance and Process at the Kitchen in 2021. With the same
                four dancers, Toni Carlson, of Viola, Minnesota, Avery Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, Laurel Atwell of
                Bainbridge, Ohio, and Charles Gowin of Hallsville, Missouri and
                with variations on the 6 parts that make up the dance, we preformed this edition in a refurbished
                warehouse in Queens.
                Like myself, the project began in Ohio and moved to and grew within NYC.</p>

            <p>I made plans to create a 3rd and final dance of the series back in Lima, to complete the hero's journey
                of the piece.
                But, despite residing in Lima for 2.5 months in the summer of 2023, I was unable to make meaningful
                connections to
                present the work and this final dance slipped through my fingers unrealized. I did my best to
                participate in the
                community and local arts organizations, but something had changed. I was looking for those who were like
                myself, only to
                find them missing among those who had left Lima, OH already to freer places. I had hoped I could break
                through what I
                thought was a digital divide, but there was no breaking through. The tea party radicals had morphed into
                anti-maskers
                who then morphed into anti-trans bathroom crusaders actively attacking school board members in Elida, a
                township outside
                Lima. The energy of the community was in the crowds demanding the school break the law or face a school
                levy defeat.
                Those who did not agree with this were gathering in a secret Facebook group for open-minded people
                called Lima
                [redacted] because “[redacted] are rare… and so are liberals in the Lima area. This group was formed to
                cultivate a safe
                community where local left leaning individuals can discuss current events… and enjoy like minded
                company.” The darkness
                I had only glimpsed from afar was now extremely close, delusional and active.</p>

            <p>I left the third dance behind with no place to exist within the Lima city limits,
                represented as a hole. To move forward and finish the project, I'm working now on the Nth and final
                edition to premiere in NYC. The nth number is an unknown and infinitely high real number, a reference to
                the very last digit in a series. It is my desire to reach the end of something that seems to be going on
                endlessly, to break the fever of fascism, for the emergence of consequences for clearly bad actors, and
                to end this project so I can move on to the next one, to the future.
